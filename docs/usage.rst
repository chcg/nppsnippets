The window consists of two parts. A combo-box where you can select the
library and underneath it is the list of snippets in the chosen library.
To insert a snippet simply double-click on the item in the list and the
snippet is inserted at the current cursor position.

When you switch to a document with another language the snippets for
that new language are read from the database.

To edit a snippet or a library, simply right-click the item.
