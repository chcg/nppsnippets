How to compile
==============

To compile NppSnippets you can use `Visual Studio`_. Project files for VS2015 are
provided and actively used. The free Visual Studio Community gets the job done.
Obviously the paid versions work as well.
To compile with newer versions of Visual Studio you can convert an existing
project file.

There is also a `MinGW-w64`_ makefile, using their 32-bit compilers. It can
be used from `Cygwin`_ and MSYS2.
