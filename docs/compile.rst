How to compile
==============

To compile NppSnippets you can use Visual Studio. Project files for VS 2013 are
provided and actively used. The free version of Visual Studio (so Express or
Community Edition) gets the job done. Obviously the paid versions work as well.
To compile with newer versions of Visual Studio you can convert an existing
project file.

There is also a `MinGW-w64`_ makefile, using their 32-bit compilers. It can
be used from `Cygwin`_ and MSYS.
