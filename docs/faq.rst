Can I assign a shortcut key to a certain snippet?
-------------------------------------------------

This is on the wish list, but I don't think it is possible.
Shortcut key are assigned to menu items when the plug-ins are loaded.
But individual snippets are not menu items. And shortcut keys need to be
dynamic. When you change the library, the key assignments need to change
on the fly.

Consider ``Ctrl-B``: this could be ``bold`` in HTML, ``break`` in a
c-styled languages and a ``begin``/``end`` block in Pascal.

But a pointer to a way to implement this is, or even better a pull request
that fixes this is much appreciated.
