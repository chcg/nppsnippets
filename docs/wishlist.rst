Wish List
=========

The wish list is in random order.

-  Real template handling: variables in the snippets

-  Select a text, right-click that selection and add as new snippet.

-  If possible, drag-and-drop from the list to the active document.

-  Assign keyboard shortcut keys to a snippet.

-  Add tooltips for the snippets (`#7`_).

-  Remember the last select snippet from the list. Useful when switching
   between different languages.

-  Add support for multiple selections (`#2`_).

-  Easier sorting for non-alphabetic libraries. (move to top, move to
   bottom, dragging?)

-  Copy a certain snippet to another library.

-  Make the snippets aware of the replace tabs with spaces setting of the
   current document.

-  Libraries can be hard to find when there is something wrong with the
   languages that are set for this library.
